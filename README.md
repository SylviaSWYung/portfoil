# My Personal Website - Summer Project 2024

During the summer of 2024, I set a goal to create a personal website that showcases my skills in both frontend and backend development. 
I've utilized Tailwind, JavaScript, and React for this project.

As of now, the project is still ***under construction*** and not yet complete. 
However, I hope it provides a glimpse of my capabilities.
